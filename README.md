#T-test
'''
If the populations are normally distributed or nearly so, and want to compare the mean of one population with the mean of another population,
then a t-test can be used (cf. nonparametric Wilcoxon test). 

Null Hypothesis: The means of both populations are equal.

Alternate Hypothesis: The means of both populations are not equal.
 
A large t-score tells you that the groups are different.

A small t-score tells you that the groups are similar.

用p value 判断是否reject
'''

T test performs a hypothesis test for the mean between two independent groups of scores 
eg. claiming the average marks between two similar courses are the same

t, p = stats.ttest_ind(p24_300mg, p24_600mg)


performs a hypothesis test for the mean between two related groups of scores
eg. claiming that a particular student's average marks in two different courses are the same

t, p = stats.ttest_rel(p24_300mg, p24_600mg)

stats.ttest_1samp(data[''],76)

p value

The p-value is below 0.05, so reject the null hypothesis: the means of both ... are not equal

p-value is larger than 0.05 so it is out of the rejection region, 

thus we can not reject the null hypothesis and decide that the  is equivalent between  and .


#画图sns

Line Plot: trends and relationships of continuous variables, such as time series data or variables changing with a parameter.

Scatter Plot: relationship between two continuous variables, helping to observe correlations or distributions between variables.
如果你想展示变量之间的关系(强)和趋势，散点图可能更合适；如果你想展示一个变量随着另一个变量的变化而变化的趋势，折线图可能更适合。

！Bar Plot: plt.bar()适用于比较不同类别或组之间的离散数据。
plt.hist()适用于展示连续变量的分布情况。

Histogram: display the distribution of numerical data, helping to understand the central tendency and dispersion of the data.

Box Plot:display the distribution of numerical data, including median, quartiles, and outliers, allowing the observation of outliers and distribution shapes.

Heatmap: Used to show the relationship between two categorical variables, often using colors to represent the degree of association or frequency.

Violin Plot: Combines the features of a box plot and a kernel density plot, used to display the distribution and density of numerical data.

Categorical Plot: Includes bar plots, count plots, box plots, etc., used to display data distribution and relationships between different categories.
